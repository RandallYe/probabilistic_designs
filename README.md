# Mechanisation of probabilistic designs in Isabelle/UTP
This repository contains our mechanisation of the theory of probabilistic designs (see papers: [Deriving Probabilistic Semantics Via the ‘Weakest Completion’](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30482-1_17) and [Probabilistic Semantics for RoboChart: A Weakest Completion Approach](https://link.springer.com/chapter/11.1007/978-3-030-31038-7_5)) in [Isabelle/UTP](https://github.com/isabelle-utp/utp-main), a UTP proof framework in Isabelle/HOL.

## Installation
This mechanisation relies on a version of Isabelle/UTP that is based on [Isabelle2019](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2019/index.html). This version of Isabelle/UTP is included in our release tag ["ramics2021"]().
