  abstract  = {The mechanisation of proofs for probabilistic systems is particularly challenging due to the verification of real-valued properties that probability entails: experience indicates [12,4,11] that there are many difficulties in automating real-number arithmetic in the context of other program features.In this paper we propose a framework for verification of probabilistic distributed systems based on the generalisation of Kleene algebra with tests that has been used as a basis for development of concurrency control in standard programming [7]. We show that verification of real-valued properties in these systems can be considerably simplified, and moreover that there is an interpretation which is susceptible to counterexample search via state exploration, despite the underlying real-number domain.},

  abstract  = {We connect probabilistic Action Systems and probabilistic CSP, inducing healthiness conditions for the probabilistic traces, failures and divergences of the latter.A probabilistic sequential semantics for pGCL [31] is “inserted underneath” an existing but non-probabilistic link between action systems and CSP. Thus the link, which earlier yielded the classic CSP healthiness conditions [34], is induced to produce probabilistic versions of them “for free”.Although probabilistic concurrency has enjoyed the attentions of a very large number of researchers over many years—including ourselves [37]—we nevertheless hope to gain new insights by combining the two approaches CSP and pGCL. In the meantime, however, we probably raise more questions than we answer: in particular, the issue of compositionality—for the moment—remains as delicate as ever.},

  abstract  = {In earlier work, we introduced probability to the B by providing a probabilistic choice substitution and by extending B’s semantics to incorporate its meaning [8]. This, a first step, allowed probabilistic programs to be written and reasoned about within B.This paper extends the previous work into refinement within B. To allow probabilistic specification and development within B, we must add a probabilistic specification substitution; and we must determine the rules and techniques for its rigorous refinement into probabilistic code.Implementation in B frequently contains loops. We generalise the standard proof obligation rules for loops giving a set of rules for reasoning about the correctness of probabilistic loops. We present a small case-study that uses those rules, the randomised Min-Cut algorithm.},

  abstract  = {Among the many opportunities offered by computational semantics for probability, the challenge of probabilistic Event B (pEB) is one of the most attractive.The B method itself is now almost 20 years old, and has been much improved and adapted over that time by the many projects to which it has been applied, and by its philosophy —right from the start— that it must be practical, effective and amenable to tool support.; more recently, EventB has extended it and altered its style of use. The probabilistic-program semantics we appeal to is even older (in Kozen’s original form), but has only recently been “revived” in the context of B-style abstraction and refinement.The especial attraction of putting the two together is the likely interplay between the probabilistic theory, on the one hand, and the decades of practical experience that have by now been built-in to the B approach, on the other.In particular, there are areas where a full theoretical treatment of probability, concurrency, abstraction and refinement —all at once— seems prohibitively complex; and yet in practice either the complexities seldom occur, or the exigencies of B’s having been so-often applied to real, non-toy problems has forced it to evolve styles for avoiding such complexities. In short, we want to use (event) B to guide us towards the issues that truly are important.Rabin’s randomized mutual-exclusion algorithm is used as a motivating case study.},

  abstract  = {Robotic systems have applications in many real-life scenarios, ranging from household cleaning to critical operations. RoboChart is a graphical language for describing robotic controllers designed specifically for autonomous and mobile robots, providing architectural constructs to identify the requirements for a robotic platform. It also provides a formal semantics in CSP. RoboChart has a probabilistic operator () but no associated probabilistic CSP semantics. When  is used, currently a non-deterministic choice () is used as semantics; this is a conservative semantics but it does not allow the analysis of stochastic properties. In this paper we define the semantics of the operator  in terms of the probabilistic CSP operator $$\boxplus $$⊞. We also show how this augmented CSP semantics for RoboChart can be translated into the PRISM probabilistic language to be able to check stochastic properties.},

We did not consider any input or output notations, or concurrency; that is the subject of Part II. We assume the reader is familiar with Part I, so that we can build on ideas presented there.},
